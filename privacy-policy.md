# Privacy Policy for Portfolio Maker Mobile

**Last Updated:** May 08, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to **Portfolio Maker Mobile** ("the App"), a portfolio application developed by CBolea. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## Information We Collect

### 1. **Data Collected Automatically**
- **Advertising Data**: The App uses Google Mobile Ads to display advertisements. This service may collect:
  - Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID).
  - IP address.
  - Approximate location (if permitted by your device settings).
  - Information about your interaction with ads.
- **WebView Data**: If you use the WebView feature to browse external websites, those websites may collect:
  - Cookies.
  - Browsing history.
  - IP address.

### 2. **Data You Provide**
- **Gallery Access**: The App uses the image picker feature, which allows you to select photos from your device’s gallery. We do not store or share these photos; they are only used within the App for display purposes.
- **In-App Purchases**: If you make purchases through the App, payment-related data (e.g., transaction IDs) may be collected by third-party payment processors. We do not store payment details like credit card numbers.

### 3. **Data Stored Locally**
- **User Preferences**: The App uses local storage to save your settings and preferences (e.g., via shared preferences). This data is stored on your device and is not shared with us or any third party.
- **File Storage**: Temporary files or cached data may be stored on your device to improve performance (e.g., via path provider).

## How We Use Your Information

- **To Provide and Improve the App**:
  - Display portfolio content and manage user settings.
  - Cache data locally for faster performance.
- **To Display Ads**:
  - Google Mobile Ads uses the collected data to serve relevant advertisements.
- **To Process In-App Purchases**:
  - Transaction data is used to facilitate purchases and provide access to premium features.
- **To Enhance User Experience**:
  - Browsing data in WebView may be used by external websites to personalize content.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described below:
- **Google Mobile Ads**: Ad data is shared with Google to display ads. Google may use this data for ad personalization and analytics. For more information, see [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **In-App Purchase Providers**: Transaction data is shared with payment processors to complete purchases.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the rights, safety, or property of ourselves or others.

## Your Choices and Rights

- **Ad Personalization**:
  - You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings:
    - On Android: Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization.
  - Disabling personalized ads will not stop ads but will make them less relevant.
- **Permissions**:
  - You can deny permissions like gallery access. However, this may limit some App features (e.g., image picker).
- **Data Stored Locally**:
  - You can clear local data by clearing the App’s cache or uninstalling the App.
- **GDPR/CCPA Rights**:
  - If you are in the EU or California, you may have rights to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of your data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data:
- Locally stored data (e.g., preferences, cached files) is kept on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
- We rely on third parties like Google to secure their services (e.g., ad data).

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to have it removed.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be posted here with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
